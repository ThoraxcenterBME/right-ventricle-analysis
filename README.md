# Right Ventricle Echo Analysis 
This repository contains code to extract curvature, volume, area, and directional strain from 3D mesh data obtained with echocardiography. 

The interface is built using OpenGL and one can analyse one mesh at a time. Drawing functionalities such as coloring regions and viewing normals on the mesh is possible. Batch analysis for multiple cycles is possible using the calculation functionalities of the repository. This works with 3D mesh data created with TomTec.
